The MySQL database password should not be stored directly in the code. Instead, it should be stored as an environment variable or in a secure credentials storage. Here's an updated version of the code snippet with the password removed and replaced with an environment variable:

```
services:
  dvwa:
    build: .
    image: ghcr.io/digininja/dvwa:latest
    # Change `always` to `build` to build from local source
    pull_policy: always
    environment:
      - DB_SERVER=db
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - dvwa
    ports:
      - 4280:80
    restart: unless-stopped

  db:
    image: docker.io/library/mariadb:10
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=dvwa
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=dvwa
      - MYSQL_USER=dvwa
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - dvwa:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - dvwa
    restart: unless-stopped
```

To use this updated code, make sure to set the `MYSQL_PASSWORD` environment variable before running the code. This way, the actual password will not be exposed in the code, and you can easily change it without modifying the code.
