<?php
header("Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8");

if (array_key_exists ("callback", $_GET)) {

echo $callback . "(".json_encode($outp).")";
To address the security vulnerability of reflecting user-controlled data, you can use PHP's built-in functions to sanitize and escape the user input. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to mitigate the issue:

```php
<?php
$userInput = $_GET['input']; // Assuming the user input is being retrieved from the query string

// Sanitize and escape the user input
$cleanInput = htmlspecialchars($userInput, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');

echo $cleanInput;
?>
```

In this modified code, we use the `htmlspecialchars` function to convert special characters to their HTML entities. This prevents potential script injection and other forms of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks by ensuring the user input is properly escaped before being echoed. The `ENT_QUOTES` flag is used to escape both single and double quotes, and `'UTF-8'` specifies the character encoding to be used.
