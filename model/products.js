Explanation:
In the original code, the `shell_exec` function is being used to execute a shell command (`ping`) with a user-controlled input (`$target`). This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the user is able to manipulate the `$target` variable.

To mitigate this vulnerability, we use the `escapeshellarg` function to escape the value of `$target` before concatenating it with the command string. This will ensure that any special characters or quotes in the input are properly escaped and treated as literal values by the shell, rather than allowing them to execute arbitrary commands.

Additionally, the `stristr(php_uname('s'), 'Windows NT')` check is replaced with `stristr(PHP_OS, 'WIN')`. This is a more reliable way to check if the server is running on a Windows operating system.
