<?php
```
if( isset( $_POST[ 'Submit' ]  ) ) {
	// Get input
	$target = $_REQUEST[ 'ip' ];

	// Sanitize the input
	$target = filter_var($target, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);

	// Determine OS and execute the ping command.
	if( stristr( php_uname( 's' ), 'Windows NT' ) ) {
		// Windows
		$cmd = shell_exec( 'ping  ' . escapeshellarg($target) );
	}
	else {
		// *nix
		$cmd = shell_exec( 'ping  -c 4 ' . escapeshellarg($target) );
	}

	// Feedback for the end user
	$html .= "<pre>{$cmd}</pre>";
}
```

Explanation:

1. The user input, `$target`, is sanitized using `filter_var()` and the `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` filter to prevent any potential command injection vulnerability.

2. The `escapeshellarg()` function is used to escape the user-controlled data before constructing the command. This ensures that any special characters or command separators are properly handled and treated as literal characters.

3. The rest of the code remains unchanged. The ping command is executed based on the OS type, and the result is displayed to the user.
