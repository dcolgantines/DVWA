The code provided is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability, where it performs a redirect based on user-controlled data ($_GET['redirect']). This can be exploited by an attacker to redirect users to malicious websites.

To fix this issue and prevent open redirect vulnerabilities, you should validate and sanitize the user input before performing any redirects. Here's the modified code:

```php
<?php
// Validate and sanitize the redirect URL
$redirect = isset($_GET['redirect']) ? $_GET['redirect'] : '';
$redirect = filter_var($redirect, FILTER_SANITIZE_URL);

if (!empty($redirect)) {
  // Perform the redirect to the sanitized URL
  header("Location: " . $redirect);
  exit;
}

http_response_code(500);
?>
<p>Missing redirect target.</p>
<?php
exit;
?>
```

In the modified code, we use `filter_var()` function to sanitize the `$_GET['redirect']` variable using the `FILTER_SANITIZE_URL` flag. This removes any potentially malicious characters from the URL.

Additionally, we explicitly check if `$redirect` is not empty before performing the redirect. If the redirect URL is empty or invalid, we return a 500 HTTP response code and display an appropriate error message instead of redirecting.
