<?php
header("Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8");

if (array_key_exists ("callback", $_GET)) {
	$callback = $_GET['callback'];
} else {
	return "";
}

$outp = array ("answer" => "15");

echo $callback . "(".json_encode($outp).")";
```php
<?php
// Ensure that PHP code execution stops immediately if this file is accessed directly
defined('ABSPATH') || exit;

// Your secure code goes here
```
```
The issue with the original code is that it doesn't contain any PHP code and directly terminates script execution. To remediate this, we can use the `defined()` function to check if a constant called 'ABSPATH' has been defined. If it is not defined, we can prevent further execution by calling `exit()`. This ensures that the code will only run if it is included by another PHP file and not accessed directly from the browser.
